# Sports Project

## project description
This is an api wrapper for displaying data from football teams, players, leagues and matches in a browser.
The data is retreived from a free online database (thesportsdb.com) and saved locally in a SQLite database to minimize API requests and loading time.
To run you have to activate both the python backend and the react frontend.

## personal experience
I made this during the summer break of my uni to practice coding with react and to learn how API's work for a backend.
This was a very interesting project and I learned a lot doing it:
- react implementation
- python backend
- API communication
- SQL usage
I dit not use git, but I just made everything locally and uploaded it once everything was done.
